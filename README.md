### Introduction
Jia-Bin Huang is an Assistant Professor in the Bradley Electrical and Computer Engineering department at Virginia Tech. His main research interests are in the area of computer vision, computer graphics and machine learning. He is particularly interested in exploiting physically grounded constraints for visual synthesis and analysis problems.

He received his PhD degree in Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign under the supervision of Prof. Narendra Ahuja.

His research topics are super-resolution (SR), optical flow, image processing, segmentation, etc. One paper related to SR is Laplacian Pyramid Super-Resolution Network (LapSRN).  
LapSRN use a coarse-to-fine procedure to progressively reconstruct the sub-band residuals of high-resolution images. And it replaces the bicubic interpolation with transposed convolutions to dramatically reduces the computational complexity. This method impresses me and give me some inspiration in SR.
